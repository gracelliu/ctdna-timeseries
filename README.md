# Evaluating Prognostic Impact of Time-Series Circulating Tumor DNA and Tumor Volume in Oropharyngeal Cancer

This repository contains the analysis scripts used in the study titled *Evaluating Prognostic Impact of Time-Series Circulating Tumor DNA and Tumor Volume in Oropharyngeal Cancer*, presented at the Medical Biophysics Summer Poster Day by Grace Liu from the Bratman Lab. The study investigates the prognostic value of serial measurements of tumour volume and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) levels in patients with oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), particularly those associated with Human Papillomavirus (HPV).

## Abstract 
Oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), particularly cases associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), has seen a significant increase in incidence. Despite advancements in definitive radiotherapy (RT), predicting patient outcomes remains a challenge. Tumor volume, often assessed through computed tomography (CT) imaging, is commonly used to evaluate tumor burden in OPC patients. Additionally, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) found in plasma offers a non-invasive biomarker that can provide valuable insights into disease progression and has shown promise in predicting patient outcomes. However, integrating both tumor volume and ctDNA levels for prognostication remains underexplored. This study focuses on the complementary prognostic value of longitudinal measurements of tumor volume and ctDNA during treatment, aiming to improve risk stratification for OPC patients.
